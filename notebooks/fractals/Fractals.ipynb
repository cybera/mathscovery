    "Here we will be generating fractals and learning about a few things as well\n",

    "1. Complex numbers (very breifly) \n",
    "2. Root finding (this is a good primer for gradient decent for those of you with ML on the mind) \n",

    "## Complex Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start talking about fractals, we should probably introduce the idea of a complex number before hand, as the fractas we will be generating rely heavily on them. I'll note that this may get kind of deep into some mathematics, and if you want to skip this section you totally can. There are som quirks to complex numbers, but luckily Python will handle them for you, and realistically they will behave like any other number in Python (for our purposes).\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, let us introduce the complex number $i$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "i  = \\sqrt{-1} \\implies i^2 = -1\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ is known as the imaginary number, or a number that when multiplied by itself, returns a negative number, an impossible situation in the real numbers (the set of numbers including integers, natural numbers, rational and irrational numbers). At first this might be concerning, but we must remember that when it comes to math, there is no concensus on whether math is discovered or invented. People thought [mathematicians who suggested working with complex numbers were crazy](https://medium.com/i-math/imaginary-numbers-explained-e5aa63bdb7ae), only for time to reveal that complex number were applicable in many areas, including [electrical engineering](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/accircuits/complex-numbers.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not, we will write a complex number as $z$, which is written as the sum of an imaginary numers real and complex parts, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = a + ib\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $a$ and $b$ are both real numbers and $i = \\sqrt{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious, you can get more details about complex numbers using the drop down below. For our purposes however, all that you really need to know is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A complex number $a + ib$ can be thought of as the classical $x,y$ ordered pair we're used to. In this case our $x$ axis is the real part of the number, and our $y$ axis is the imaginary part of the number\n",
    "\n",
    "2. These $(a, b)$ ordered pairs can be used to define the \"complex plane\", which we will use to plot our fractals\n",

    "There are a lot of very useful properties that come from imaginary numbers, and they're used all the time in fiels such as pure mathematics, signal processing, physics, chemistry, fluid dynamics... in principle we could go on forever. The largest reason for this is due to something known as [eulers formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula), where we instead think of complex numbers on the \"complex plane\", with the real part of the function $a$ representing our $x$ axis, and the imaginary part of our function $b$ on the $y$ axis. Euler's formula states that we can write the exponential of a complex number as follows\n",

    "For those of you mathematically inclined and want to prove this, the easiest way is to write out the Taylor series for each $e^{ix}, i\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$, and you may be surprised what you see. \n",
    "\n",
    "Long story short, using Euler's formula, we can essentially write any complex number in terms of sine and cosine, this is useful for a whole lot of reasons, but for fractals specificially, this implies periodic boundary conditions -- we expect to see repeating patterns. Indeed, as cosine and sine have $N$ roots repeating every $\\pi$, we expect that our complex functions may also have (up to) that many roots!\n",

    "### Finding Roots Of Complex Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "We all remember polynomial equations of real numbers, for example the quadratic function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^2 - C = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where we can all read quite readily that the solution to this equation is $x = \\pm \\sqrt{C}$. But what about if we have some complex polynomial like\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z^2 + C = 0,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To be honest, I pulled a fast one on you. It' just as easy! In this case, we have two roots which are $\\pm i \\sqrt{C} $, where we just bring our friend the imaginary unit along for the ride. In principle what we do is we once again factor this into the real and imaginary part of the solution, but often it's easier to think of this (in a way that will make mathmaticians cry) we simply get rid of the part we don't like, and call it $i$. For quadratic complex polynomial equations, we can simply use the quadratic formula and sprinkle in the imaginary unit where ever we need it. This is a bit of an over simplification, but for our purposes it should be fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where this can get a little spicier is when the roots aren't obvious enough to be read off. For example, the equation\n",

    "$$\n",

    "is cubic, which means we have three distinct roots which satisfy this equation. In this case, it is easier to look at our friend Euler's formula to find these roots. So let's rewrite our complex equation above using euler's formula. First, the left hand side\n",

    "$$\n",
    "z = r e^{ix} \\implies z^3 = r^3 e^{3ix}\n",

    "# Root Finding With Complex Numbers\n",

    "If you were crazy enough to read the drop down menu, you may have noticed that finding roots to complex equations were more work that the quadratic formula. And if you take anything away from these notebooks it should be that we Data Scientists (and regular scientists) are _super_ lazy. Wouldn't it be nice if we could use our computer to solve these for us? Luckily, the answer is a resounding yes! And even more better is that our Newton Raphson formula from before generalizes to the complex domain without us having to do anything. Convenient! \n",

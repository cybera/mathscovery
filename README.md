# Mathsovery 

This is the repository where some (not boring) technical deep dives into doing math with computers will be saved. The idea is that we will store lots of information that will be presented over Lunch-N'-Learn sessions for the Data Science team (or anyone else that wants to come). In principle, this should also work as a stand alone repository for anyone to learn or have a refresher on (numerical) mathematics. 

## Organization
Each topic ideally is introduced in its own notebook for easy access. Certainly - there will be some topics that lean heavily on previous topics/other knowledge. It is my hope that this will be layed out clearly so the intended order is clear. i.e. the prerequisite knowledge for each notebook is clear by the organization of the repository and/or a list with links to said prerequisite knowledge at the beginning of each notebook.

### The Dream
Depending on how the Jupyter Books go - with enough time maybe we can turn this into what is essentially a text book so we don't have to worry about things happening in the wrong order 

## Background knowledge assumed
Each notebook will have different background knowledge, and we will offer (brief) reviews of required concepts before they're used. But in general, familiarity with the following topics is assumed

1. Calculus (univariate and multivariate/vector)
2. Linear algebra
3. Statistics (distributions and the like) 

## Resources

I'll add to this list as I go, but in terms of raw content and explainations I cannot recommend Numerical Recipes by Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling and Flannery (this is Alex's version of the Pragmatic Programmer). It has the advantage that it explains the theory and then demonstrates the code (however, the code is not... fantastic (and also it is in C) but as a resource, it is invaluable. )
